A variety of shaders I developed for the in-development game Crowns (https://twitter.com/crowns_dev/)

  *pixelColorReplacement.shader    Reads the RGB value of an image and replaces it with the color from a palette	
  *pixelCutOut.shader 	            Takes the same input and makes a cut-out of the monster's sprite
  *pixelShadowReplacement.shader 	Takes the same input and generates an accurate shadow suitable for placing beneath the monster.
  *playerColorReplacement.shader   Performs the same function for pixelColorReplacement.shader but for the player character

  *ImagePaletteApplied.png           An example of before and after the pixelColorReplacement.shader
